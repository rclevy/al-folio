### Women in Science and Engineering
Currently, I am involved with the Women in Science and Engineering ([WISE](https://wise.arizona.edu/)) Program at the University of Arizona. I have served as a guest lecturer for the Imagine Your STEM Future ([IYSF](https://wise.arizona.edu/imagine-your-stem-future)) program and am [developing astronomy curriculum](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1UUYzn8Jej_imQFitYFOTIEtYxPLFBB2p?usp=drive_link) for that program. I have also given a guest lecture as part of the [Bio/Diversity Project](https://wise.arizona.edu/biodiversity-project) on [Translational Science Communication](https://github.com/rclevy/rclevy.github.io/blob/master/assets/pdf/BioDiversity_GuestLecture_TranslationalSciComm_RLevy_20230405.pdf). Stay tuned for more updates on my involvement with WISE!

### GRAD-MAP
As a PhD student at the University of Maryland, I was involved with [GRAD-MAP](http://www.umdgradmap.org) (Graduate Resources Advancing Diversity with Maryland Astronomy and Physics), which pairs undergraduates from historically black colleges and universities, minority serving institutions, and community colleges primarily from the mid-Atlantic region with a mentor in either the UMD astronomy or physics departments. During the winter break, these students attend a ten-day [Winter Workshop](https://www.umdgradmap.org/copy-of-winter-workshop), where they learn Python, work on a research project with their mentor(s), and learn information and resources to help them apply for graduate school. For four years, I served as a research mentor for a student. For the last three years, I developed the student's project independently and also assisted with some of the professional development during the Winter Workshop. In the summer of 2019, I was a co-mentor for a student in GRAD-MAP's ten-week [Summer Scholars program](https://www.umdgradmap.org/summer-scholars-1).

### Education and Public Outreach with NOIRLab
As an undergraduate at the University of Arizona, I worked in [education and public outreach at NOIRLab (formerly NOAO)](https://noirlab.edu/public/products/educational-programs/) in Tucson, AZ as the lead student for two years. I ran programs for schools and classrooms, developed activities and materials, organized teacher workshops, [published a monthly newsletter](https://www.globeatnight.org/news.php), [wrote and recorded a bi-monthly podcast](https://cosmoquest.org/x/365daysofastronomy/category/podcast/globe-at-night-podcast/),  [coordinated the translation of materials](https://www.globeatnight.org/downloads), and [ran a social media site](https://www.facebook.com/GLOBEatNight). I was also one of the key developers for the [UNESCO International Year of Light 2015 Quality Lighting Teaching Kit](https://noirlab.edu/public/products/education/edu001/), which has been distributed to partner organizations worldwide. I was also a character in two installments of NOAO's comic strip ["Tales of the Modern Astronomer"](https://noirlab.edu/public/media/archives/education/pdf/edu003.pdf), which have been featured at AAS conferences and on the covers of past NOAO Newsletters!
