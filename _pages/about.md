## Welcome!

I'm a National Science Foundation Astronomy & Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellow at the [University of Arizona](https://www.as.arizona.edu). I study the effects of stellar feedback in nearby galaxies using multiwavelength observations of gas tracers, with a focus on (sub)millimeter interferometric, near-far infrared, and optical IFU measurements.

I grew up outside of Houston, Texas. I received my B.S. degrees in Astronomy and Physics at the University of Arizona. I earned my M.S. and Ph.D. in Astronomy at the University of Maryland. In addition to astronomy, I love trying new restaurants and cuisines, cooking, traveling, and hiking.
