## JWST Views of Extraplanar Gas and Dust in NGC891
I am involved in a [Cycle 1 JWST program](https://www.stsci.edu/jwst/phase2-public/2180.pdf) to use near- and mid-infrared data from JWST to measure the extraplanar gas and dust properties of the edge-on galaxy NGC891. Stay tuned for more updates about this project!

## Extraplanar Diffuse Ionized Gas (eDIG) in Edge-On Galaxies
#### [Levy et al. 2019](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJ...882...84L/abstract)

We directly and kinematically measure eDIG in a sample of edge-on CALIFA galaxies, and investigate the ionization and origin of this phase. Photometrically and kinematically detected eDIG is commonplace in these galaxies.

## eDIG in Intermediate Inclination Galaxies
#### [Levy et al. 2018](http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018ApJ...860...92L)

We use a novel method of comparing the molecular and ionized gas rotation curves to kinematically measure extraplanar diffuse ionized gas (eDIG) in intermediate inclination galaxies from the EDGE-CALIFA survey. We find that the majority of our sample shows evidence for eDIG, meaning this phase is ubiquitous in star-forming galaxies.
