## Velocity-resolved [CII] in and around M82
#### Levy et al. 2023, in prep.

We use new observations from SOFIA to detect [CII] in the starburst nucleus and southern outflow of M82. We find that most of the [CII] in the outflow of M82 is associated with the neutral atomic gas.

## JWST Views of Starburst Outflows

I am involved in a [Cycle 1 JWST program](https://www.stsci.edu/jwst/phase2-public/1701.pdf) to measure the near- and mid-infrared properties of two archetypal starburst galaxies: NGC253 and M82. Stay tuned for more updates on this project!
