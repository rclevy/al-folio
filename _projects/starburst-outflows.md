## JWST Views of Starburst Outflows

I am involved in a [Cycle 1 JWST program](https://www.stsci.edu/jwst/phase2-public/1701.pdf) to measure the near- and mid-infrared properties of two archetypal starburst galaxies: NGC253 and M82.

#### [Bolatto, Levy et al. 2024](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024ApJ...967...63B/abstract)

We detect the base of the superwind in M82 in PAH emission and reveal a highly filamentary and bubble-like structure. The PAH emission resembles that of the ionized gas, suggesting that the PAHs are embedded in a combination of neutral, molecular, and photoionized gas (see also [Fisher et al. 2024](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024arXiv240503686F/abstract)).

## Velocity-resolved [CII] in and around M82
#### [Levy et al. 2023](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023ApJ...958..109L/abstract)
We use new observations from SOFIA to detect [CII] in the starburst nucleus and southern outflow of M82. We find that most of the [CII] in the outflow of M82 is associated with the neutral atomic gas.
