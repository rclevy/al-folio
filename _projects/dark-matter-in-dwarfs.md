## Dynamical Measurements of Dark Matter Profiles of Dwarf Galaxies
#### [Cooke, Levy et al. 2021](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.512.1012C/abstract)

In this paper lead by high school student Lauren Cooke, we combine kinematic data on the molecular gas and the stars in a sample of dwarf galaxies to measure the dark matter density profiles. We find that the inner dark matter density slope is consistent with other measurements, but are steeper than predicted by some simulations when the slopes are measured in the same way. This may mean that stellar feedback is inefficient at influencing the dark matter in these relatively massive dwarf galaxies.
