## eDIG in Edge-On Galaxies

We directly and kinematically measure eDIG in a sample of edge-on CALIFA galaxies, and investigate the ionization and origin of this phase. Photometrically and kinematically detected eDIG is commonplace in these galaxies.



## eDIG in Intermediate Inclination Galaxies

We use a novel method of comparing the molecular and ionized gas rotation curves to kinematically measure extraplanar diffuse ionized gas (eDIG) in intermediate inclination galaxies from the EDGE-CALIFA survey. We find that the majority of our sample shows evidence for eDIG, meaning this phase is ubiquitous in star-forming galaxies.
